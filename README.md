# server-tools

A collection of compiled NGS tools for distribution across servers.

## Motivation

The aim of this repository is to provide a means of distributing compiled binaries and executables of NGS tools across multiple servers. Instead of maintaining each software separately on each machine, they are compiled and prepared on a single one, pushed, and are ready to be pulled and used in other servers with a similar architecture.
